## 1. Purpose

This document specifies the complete requirements, architecture, design decisions, and compiler constraints for ZVI — a VI-compatible text editor targeting the CP/M 2.2 and CP/M 3.0 operating systems. It is intended to serve as a self-contained reference that would allow the application to be fully recreated from scratch.

---

## 2. Target Platform

### 2.1 Operating System
- **Primary:** CP/M 2.2 and CP/M 3.0
- **CPU:** Zilog Z80 (8-bit, 16-bit address space, 64 KB total)
- **TPA (Transient Program Area):** Typically 48–56 KB available for program + data + heap + stack
- **Minimum TPA:** 48 KB recommended

### 2.2 Compiler: HI-TECH C V3.09 for Z80/CP/M
- K&R C (pre-ANSI), not C89 or later
- `int` is **2 bytes** on Z80 (not 4)
- `long` is **4 bytes**
- `char` is **1 byte**, default **unsigned** when used via `unsigned char` cast
- No `memmove` in the standard library — must be provided by the application
- `malloc` and `free` are available but with important limitations (see Section 7)
- `fopen`, `fclose`, `fgetc`, `fputc`, `fseek`, `ftell`, `fprintf`, `sprintf` are available
- `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` are available; `stderr` maps to the CP/M console
- `bios(fn, bc, de)` and `bdos(fn, de)` are available via `<cpm.h>` for direct system calls
- `getch()` is in the HI-TECH C runtime — reads a raw keypress without echo
- The compiler driver is named `C` (not `cc`); the linker is named `LINQ` (not `link`)
- CP/M filenames are 8.3 uppercase; HI-TECH C upcases filenames automatically

### 2.3 Terminal
- ANSI/VT100 escape sequences required
- Default assumed geometry: **80 columns × 24 rows**
- Terminal size queried at startup via ANSI CPR (cursor-position report); defaults used if terminal does not respond
- Compatible terminals: VT100, VT220, xterm, ANSI.SYS, and most modern terminal emulators connected via serial

## 4. Build

### 4.1 Compile and Link (on CP/M)
```
C -C ZVI.C
C -C GAP.C
C -C TERM.C
C -C SCREEN.C
C -C EMOVE.C
C -C EDIT.C
C -C EREPEAT.C
C -C EX.C
LINQ -Z -N -C100H -OZVI.COM CRTCPM.OBJ ZVI.OBJ GAP.OBJ TERM.OBJ SCREEN.OBJ EMOVE.OBJ EDIT.OBJ EREPEAT.OBJ EX.OBJ LIBC.LIB
```

### 4.2 Debug Build
Add `-H` to each compile step to enable debug symbol output (symbol table only). The internal `-d` application logging scaffolding has been permanently removed to minimize the binary footprint for strict CP/M environments.

### 4.3 Cross-Compilation (Linux/macOS)
```
c -c zvi.c gap.c term.c screen.c emove.c edit.c erepeat.c ex.c
linq -Z -N -C100H -ozvi.com crtcpm.obj zvi.obj gap.obj term.obj screen.obj emove.obj edit.obj erepeat.obj ex.obj libc.lib
```

### 4.4 Load Address
`-C100H` sets the load address to 0x0100, which is the standard CP/M program load address.

---

## 5. Invocation

```
ZVI [filename]
```

- If `filename` is given and exists, it is loaded into the gap buffer.
- If `filename` is given but does not exist, the editor starts with an empty buffer and the status shows `[New File]`.
- If no filename is given, the editor starts with an empty unnamed buffer.

---

## 6. Editor Architecture

### 6.1 Global State
All editor state is in a single global `Editor ed` struct defined in `zvi.c` and externed everywhere else. This avoids passing pointers and keeps code simple for K&R C.

### 6.2 Modes
| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `MODE_NORMAL` | 0 | Command (normal) mode |
| `MODE_INSERT` | 1 | Insert/append/open mode |
| `MODE_REPLACE` | 2 | Replace mode (reserved, not currently used) |
| `MODE_CMDLINE` | 3 | Ex command-line mode |

### 6.3 Gap Buffer (`gap.c`)
The file content is stored as a gap buffer:
```
[text before gap][  GAP space  ][text after gap]
```
- `gb.buf`: the raw allocated block
- `gb.size`: total allocation in bytes (includes gap)
- `gb.gstart`: index of first gap byte
- `gb.gend`: index of first non-gap byte after the gap
- **Content length** = `gb.size - (gb.gend - gb.gstart)`
- Insertions move the gap to the cursor position and fill from the front
- Deletions expand the gap (no data movement needed)
- `GAP_MIN = 256`: minimum gap size; if the gap is smaller than this, the buffer is considered full

Key functions:
- `gb_init()` — allocates the buffer
- `gb_free()` — releases the buffer
- `gb_content_len()` — returns logical content length
- `gb_char_at(pos)` — returns character at logical position (handles gap transparently)
- `gb_insert(pos, text, len)` — insert text at logical position
- `gb_delete(pos, len)` — delete len bytes at logical position (expands gap)
- `gb_load(filename, fp)` — opens and loads a file; when `fp` is non-NULL, uses that already-open handle instead of calling `fopen()` (see Section 7.2)
- `gb_save(filename)` — saves buffer to file
- `gb_load_more(n)` — loads next n bytes from tail (large-file paging)

### 6.4 Large File Support (Sliding Window)
When a file exceeds the available buffer, ZVI loads the first `BUF_MAX` bytes and records the byte offset where loading stopped (`tail_offset`) and the source filename (`tail_file`). Additional state:
- `win_start`: byte offset in the original file where the in-memory buffer begins (for files scrolled forward)
- `tail_offset`: byte offset in `tail_file` where the unloaded portion begins (0 = fully loaded)
- `tail_file[PATH_MAX]`: filename of the original source

On every `:w` save, the full file is reconstructed: head (bytes before `win_start`) + in-memory buffer + tail (bytes from `tail_offset`). When saving to the same file that holds the tail, a temporary file `ZVITMP.TMP` is used as an intermediate to avoid reading and writing the same file simultaneously.

Paging in: `gb_load_more(LOAD_CHUNK)` reads the next `LOAD_CHUNK = 4096` bytes from the tail. If the buffer is full, `gb_discard_head(n)` discards n bytes from the head (advancing `win_start`) to make room. The discard is capped at `ed.cur_pos` so the cursor is never lost.

Limitations: edits are restricted to the in-memory window. Content beyond `tail_offset` is preserved verbatim on save but cannot be edited until paged in.

### 6.5 Undo
Single-level undo. The `UndoRec` struct stores:
- `type`: `UNDO_NONE`, `UNDO_INSERT`, or `UNDO_DELETE`
- `pos`: buffer position of the operation
- `len`: number of characters
- `was_clean`: non-zero if the buffer was unmodified before this operation (allows `u` to clear the modified flag)
- `text[UNDO_MAX]`: saved text for delete operations (insert operations recover text from the buffer)

`UNDO_MAX = 1024` bytes. Delete operations that exceed this are truncated in the undo record.

### 6.6 Yank Buffer
- `yank[YANK_MAX]`: null-terminated yanked text, `YANK_MAX = 1024`
- `yank_len`: length of yanked text
- `yank_line`: non-zero if the yank was a whole-line operation (affects `p`/`P` paste behavior)

### 6.7 Dot-Repeat Buffer
Tracks the last change command for replay with `.`:
- `dot_cmd`: primary command key (0 = none)
- `dot_motion`: motion for `d`/`c` operators
- `dot_arg`: extra argument (replacement character for `r`)
- `dot_count`: count when the command was originally issued
- `dot_len`: length of stored insertion text
- `dot_text[DOT_TEXT_MAX]`: text to re-insert for insert-mode commands, `DOT_TEXT_MAX = 128`

Insert text is captured when ESC exits insert mode, reading from `undo.pos` for `undo.len` bytes (the text is still in the buffer at that point). If inserted text exceeds `DOT_TEXT_MAX`, it is silently truncated.

### 6.8 Search
- `search[SEARCH_MAX]`: current search pattern, `SEARCH_MAX = 64`
- `search_dir`: `SEARCH_FWD` (+1) or `SEARCH_BWD` (-1)
- Search is a simple substring scan (no regex). Wraps around end/beginning of buffer.

### 6.9 Screen Model
- The text area occupies rows `0` through `scr_rows - 2`.
- Row `scr_rows - 1` is the status/command line.
- **Visual rows**: lines wider than `scr_cols` wrap to additional terminal rows. The unit of vertical measurement is one terminal line of content. `top_pos` may point to the middle of a logical line (start of any visual row).
- `TAB_STOP = 8`: tab characters expand to the next multiple of 8.
- Lines past the end of the file are shown as `~` in column 0 (except row 0).
- Status line shows: filename, `[+]` if modified, current line number, or a transient message (search result, error, mode indicator).
- `line_cnt_cached` in the `Editor` struct caches the total line count computed by `scr_line_count()`. Set to 0 (invalid) by `gb_insert()` and `gb_delete()` whenever buffer content changes; recomputed on the next status bar update. This avoids an O(buffer) scan on every cursor movement.

---

## 7. Compiler Constraints and Workarounds

### 7.1 K&R C Style
HI-TECH C V3.09 uses K&R (pre-ANSI) C syntax. All function definitions use the old-style parameter declaration syntax:
```c
int gb_insert(pos, text, len)
int   pos;
char *text;
int   len;
{
    ...
}
```
ANSI-style prototypes (`int gb_insert(int pos, char *text, int len)`) are **not** used. All extern declarations in `zvi.h` use empty parameter lists:
```c
int gb_insert(/* int pos, char *text, int len */);
```

### 7.2 Heap Exhaustion and `fopen()` Failure
**Problem:** HI-TECH C's `fopen()` allocates a `BUFSIZ`-sized I/O buffer from the heap for each file it opens. `gb_init()` allocates nearly the entire heap for the gap buffer, leaving no room for `fopen()` to succeed. Every subsequent file open returns `NULL`.



**Root cause:** The heap on this CP/M system is approximately 24–40 KB. A single `malloc` call can consume virtually all of it.

**Solution:** In `zvi.c::main()`, the input file is opened with `fopen()` **before** `gb_init()` is called — while the heap is still fully available. The resulting `FILE*` is passed as the second argument to `gb_load(filename, fp)`. When `fp` is non-NULL, `gb_load()` uses that already-open handle directly rather than calling `fopen()`. `gb_init()` then allocates the gap buffer from whatever heap remains.

After `gb_load()` closes the file with `fclose()`, the I/O buffer is returned to the heap (assuming HI-TECH C's `fclose()` calls `free()` internally), making it available for subsequent `fopen()` calls in `gb_save()` and `gb_load_more()`.

**Probe strategy (abandoned):** An earlier attempt used a probe allocation to find the largest available heap block, then freed it and re-allocated a smaller block to leave headroom. This failed because on CP/M, `free()` may not reliably return memory to the free list, causing the probe to permanently consume heap in addition to the actual allocation.

### 7.3 IX Frame Elimination (Binary Size Optimisation)

HI-TECH C V3.09 generates an IX-register stack frame in every function that has at least one `auto` (stack-allocated) local variable. The prologue/epilogue sequence (`PUSH IX` / `LD IX,0` / `ADD IX,SP` / one `DEC SP` per local byte / `LD SP,IX` / `POP IX`) costs 12–16 bytes per function. For a codebase with many small functions this overhead is significant.

**Solution:** Declare local variables as `static` instead of `auto`. File-level `static` variables and function-scope `static` variables are placed in BSS (fixed addresses) and accessed without IX. If **all** locals in a function are `static` (or if the function has no locals), the compiler emits no IX frame at all.

**Constraints:**
- Only safe for non-recursive, single-threaded functions (all functions in ZVI satisfy this — CP/M is single-process, single-thread).
- Inner-block declarations (inside `switch` cases, `if` blocks) also contribute to the IX frame and must be hoisted to function-scope `static`.
- Functions with `static` locals are not re-entrant. This is intentional and safe here.

**Affected functions (v1.3):**

| File | Functions |
|------|-----------|
| `screen.c` | `next_vrow`, `vrow_start_of`, `scr_vrow_col`, `scr_pos_line`, `scr_cur_line`, `scr_pos_col`, `scr_line_start`, `scr_line_count`, `draw_row_at`, `scr_show_status`, `scr_update_after_move` |
| `edit.c` | `get_count`, `do_find`, `insert_key` |
| `emove.c` | `undo_save_delete`, `pos_at_col`, `mv_bnb`, `mv_eol`, `mv_right`, `mv_up`, `mv_down`, `mv_word_fwd`, `mv_word_back`, `mv_word_end`, `apply_op`, `read_pattern`, `do_search_from` |

**Additional dead code removed (v1.3):**
- `gb_load_fp()` — merged into `gb_load(filename, fp)` via an optional `FILE*` parameter. When `fp` is non-NULL it is used directly; otherwise `fopen()` is called internally. Eliminates the entire function body and its IX frame.
- `scr_redraw_cur_vrow()` — single-visual-row redraw used only by `r` (replace character). Replaced with `scr_redraw_cur_line()`, which redraws the full logical line. The result is identical for single-width lines and correct for wrapped lines. Eliminates ~60 bytes.
- `scr_line_end()` — declared in `zvi.h` and defined in `screen.c` but never called anywhere. Eliminated as dead code (~40 bytes).

### 7.4 HI-TECH C Compiler Limits

#### 7.4.1 Optimizer Memory Limit: "optim: Out of memory"
**Problem:** HI-TECH C's optimizer has a fixed memory budget for processing a single function. Functions beyond a certain complexity cause the compiler to abort with `optim: Out of memory`.

**Solution:** Keep all functions small. When a function grows too large (typically beyond ~80–120 lines with many local variables and branches), split it into multiple smaller static helper functions.

**Affected functions in this codebase:**
- `gap.c::gb_save()` — split into `gb_write_head()`, `gb_write_buf()`, `gb_write_tail()`
- `gap.c::gb_load()` — split out `gb_record_tail()`
- `gap.c::gb_load_more()` — split out `gb_discard_head()`
- `edit.c::normal_cmd()` — split into `normal_edit_cmd()`, `normal_delchg_cmd()`, `normal_misc_cmd()`, `normal_find_cmd()`, `normal_page_cmd()`

#### 7.4.2 Per-File Label Limit: "Too many temporary labels"
**Problem:** HI-TECH C generates an assembly label for every `if`, `while`, `for`, `&&`, `||`, `switch` case, and ternary expression. There is a hard per-file limit on the total number of these temporary labels. When a `.C` file generates too many labels across all its functions combined, the assembler phase aborts with `Too many temporary labels`.

This is distinct from the optimizer memory limit: splitting a large function into smaller functions within the **same** `.C` file does not help, because the label count is per-file, not per-function.

**Solution:** Move code to a **new source file**. Choose a logically cohesive cluster of functions and extract them into a separate `.C` file that is compiled and linked independently.

**Affected in this codebase:**
- `erepeat.c` was created to hold `dot_ins_position()`, `dot_replay_c()`, and `dot_replay()`, which were extracted from `edit.c` to reduce `edit.c`'s total label count.

### 7.5 Variable Declaration Rules (K&R C)
All variable declarations must appear at the **top** of their enclosing block, before any statements. Declaring a variable after a statement in the same block is illegal in K&R C and will cause a compile error.

```c
/* ILLEGAL in K&R C: */
int x = 5;
foo();
int y = 10;   /* error: declaration after statement */

/* CORRECT: */
int x, y;
x = 5;
foo();
y = 10;
```

This applies inside `switch` case bodies as well — use explicit `{ }` blocks to create a new scope when you need local variables per case.

**Special caution with `long`:** Declaring a `long` variable inside a nested block (rather than at the function top) has been observed to cause optimizer failures on HI-TECH C. All `long` variables should be declared at the top of their function.

### 7.6 No `memmove()`
HI-TECH C V3.09 does not include `memmove()` in its library. The gap buffer requires an overlapping-safe memory copy for gap movement. A private implementation named `gb_memmove()` is provided in `gap.c`.

### 7.7 Integer Width
On Z80, `int` is 2 bytes (range −32768 to 32767). Buffer positions and sizes are stored as `int`, which limits the effective buffer to 32 KB. This is acceptable given CP/M TPA constraints. File offsets (e.g., `tail_offset`, `win_start`) are stored as `long` (4 bytes) to support files larger than 32 KB.

### 7.8 Terminal Input
CP/M does not have a `termios`-style raw mode API. HI-TECH C's `getch()` function reads a single character without echo using the BIOS CONIN call directly. No setup or teardown is required for raw mode.

### 7.9 Terminal Size Query and BIOS CONIN
**Problem:** The ANSI CPR response (`ESC[rows;colsR`) is fragmented on CP/M emulators running under a Unix host with canonical (line-buffered) terminal mode. The ESC byte arrives immediately, but the remaining bytes are buffered until Enter is pressed.

**Solution:** `term_getsize()` uses a two-phase approach:
1. **Phase 1:** Poll BIOS CONST (`bios(2,0,0)`) up to 30,000 times waiting for any byte.
2. **Phase 2:** Read the full CPR sequence using BIOS CONIN (`bios(3,0,0)`) directly, bypassing BDOS buffering. No BDOS console output is performed between CONIN reads.

All debug output from the size query is deferred until after Phase 2 completes, because BDOS console-write calls between reads can consume buffered response bytes on some CP/M implementations.

If the terminal does not respond, `DEF_ROWS = 24` and `DEF_COLS = 80` are used.

### 7.10 File I/O Buffer Count
`gb_save()` opens at most **two** files simultaneously: the output file and the source file (for head/tail reads). The pre-open strategy ensures the initial file's I/O buffer is allocated before the gap buffer consumes the heap. If `free()` works (returns memory to the heap on `fclose()`), the pattern of open-read/write-close ensures only one or two file handles are live at any moment.

---

## 8. File Format

- Files are read in binary mode (`"rb"`).
- On load: bare `CR` (0x0D) characters are stripped. `CR+LF` pairs are normalized to `LF`.
- On save: each `LF` is written as `CR+LF` (CP/M convention).
- CP/M EOF marker `Ctrl-Z` (0x1A) terminates saved files.
- On load: `Ctrl-Z` stops reading (CP/M EOF convention).
- Internal representation: pure `LF`-terminated lines.

## 10. Supported Commands

### 10.1 Normal Mode — Movement

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` | Move left one character (within line) |
| `l` | Move right one character (within line) |
| `j` | Move down one line (preserves want_col) |
| `k` | Move up one line (preserves want_col) |
| `Enter` | Move to first non-blank character of the next line |
| `w` | Forward to start of next word |
| `b` | Backward to start of previous word |
| `e` | Forward to end of word |
| `0` | Move to beginning of line |
| `^` | Move to first non-blank of line |
| `$` | Move to end of line |
| `G` | Go to last line (or line N with count prefix) |
| `gg` | Go to first line (or line N: `5gg`) |
| `Ctrl-F` | Scroll forward one page; cursor lands at the middle row of the new page (first non-blank). No-op if the last line of the file is already visible. |
| `Ctrl-B` | Scroll backward one page; cursor lands at the middle row of the new page (first non-blank). No-op if `top_pos == 0` (file beginning already displayed). |
| `Ctrl-D` | Scroll forward half page |
| `Ctrl-U` | Scroll backward half page |

Vertical movement maintains a "wanted column" (`want_col`) so that `j`/`k` through short lines returns to the original column when a longer line is reached.

`j` triggers `gb_load_more()` when the cursor approaches the end of loaded content and a tail exists.

`Enter` behaves identically to `j` for screen update purposes but lands on the first non-blank character of the destination line (same as `^` after `j`). Accepts a count prefix.

### 10.2 Normal Mode — Insert / Append

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` | Insert before cursor |
| `a` | Append after cursor |
| `I` | Insert at beginning of line (first non-blank) |
| `A` | Append at end of line |
| `o` | Open new line below, enter insert mode |
| `O` | Open new line above, enter insert mode |
| `s` | Substitute character(s): delete then insert |
| `S` | Substitute entire line: delete line content then insert |

### 10.3 Normal Mode — Delete / Change

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `x` | Delete character under cursor |
| `X` | Delete character before cursor |
| `dd` | Delete current line |
| `dw` | Delete word forward |
| `db` | Delete word backward |
| `d$` | Delete to end of line |
| `d0` | Delete to beginning of line |
| `dG` | Delete to end of file |
| `D` | Delete to end of line (alias for `d$`) |
| `cc` | Change current line |
| `cw` | Change word |
| `c$` | Change to end of line |
| `C` | Change to end of line (alias for `c$`) |
| `r` | Replace single character under cursor |
| `J` | Join line below to current line (inserts space) |
| `~` | Toggle case of character under cursor |

### 10.4 Normal Mode — Yank and Put

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `yy` | Yank (copy) current line |
| `Y` | Yank current line (alias for `yy`) |
| `yw` | Yank word |
| `y$` | Yank to end of line |
| `p` | Put after cursor / below current line (linewise) |
| `P` | Put before cursor / above current line (linewise) |

### 10.5 Normal Mode — Search

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Search forward for pattern |
| `?` | Search backward for pattern |
| `n` | Repeat last search in same direction |
| `N` | Repeat last search in opposite direction |

Search is a plain substring match (no regular expressions). Wraps around end of buffer.

### 10.6 Normal Mode — Character Search (within current line)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f{c}` | Move to next occurrence of `c` on current line |
| `F{c}` | Move to previous occurrence of `c` on current line |
| `;` | Repeat last `f`/`F` in same direction |
| `,` | Repeat last `f`/`F` in opposite direction |

All accept a count prefix (`3;` = skip to third match).

### 10.7 Normal Mode — Miscellaneous

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `.` | Repeat last change |
| `u` | Undo last change (single level) |
| `:` | Enter ex command mode |
| `Ctrl-L` | Redraw screen |

### 10.8 Dot-Repeat (`.`) Behavior

The `.` command repeats the last **change** at the current cursor position:

| Last command | Dot behavior |
|-------------|-------------|
| `x` / `X` | Delete same count of characters |
| `r{c}` | Replace current character with same `{c}` |
| `D` | Delete to end of line |
| `~` | Toggle case of same count of characters |
| `J` | Join same count of lines |
| `dd` / `dw` / `d$` etc. | Re-apply same delete motion |
| `cw<text>ESC` / `cc<text>ESC` | Delete same motion range and re-insert same text |
| `C<text>ESC` | Change to EOL and re-insert same text |
| `i<text>ESC` | Re-insert same text at current position |
| `a<text>ESC` | Re-append same text (cursor advances past current char first) |
| `A<text>ESC` | Re-append same text at end of current line |
| `I<text>ESC` | Re-insert same text at first non-blank of line |
| `o<text>ESC` | Open new line below and re-insert same text |
| `O<text>ESC` | Open new line above and re-insert same text |
| `s<text>ESC` / `S<text>ESC` | Re-insert same text at current position |

An explicit count prefix to `.` (e.g., `3.`) overrides the stored count. Bare `.` uses the stored count from the original command.

Inserted text for dot-repeat is captured at ESC time from `undo.pos` / `undo.len`, capped at `DOT_TEXT_MAX = 128` bytes. Yank (`y`) commands do not update the dot-repeat record.

### 10.9 Count Prefix

Most commands accept a numeric count prefix that repeats or scales the operation:
- `5j` — move down 5 lines
- `3dw` — delete 3 words
- `2dd` — delete 2 lines
- `10G` — go to line 10
- `3;` — repeat `f`/`F` search 3 times

### 10.10 Insert Mode

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| (any printable) | Insert character at cursor |
| `Enter` / `Ctrl-M` | Insert newline |
| `Backspace` / `Ctrl-H` / `DEL` | Delete previous character |
| `Ctrl-W` | Delete previous word |
| `Ctrl-U` | Delete to start of line |
| `ESC` | Return to normal mode |

Insert mode optimises terminal output on slow (9600 baud) connections:
- Regular character (no wrap): emit the byte directly; no escape sequences.
- Backspace at end of line: `BS` + `ESC[K`.
- Character causing a visual-row wrap: redraw from cursor row to bottom.
- Newline / backspace over newline / `Ctrl-W`: full screen refresh.
- ESC: redraw only the edited line unless the viewport scrolled.
- The `-- INSERT --` mode indicator is shown once on mode entry, not refreshed on every keypress.

### 10.11 Ex Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `:w` | Write (save) current file |
| `:w filename` | Write to named file |
| `:q` | Quit (fails if unsaved changes) |
| `:q!` | Quit and discard changes |
| `:wq` | Write then quit |
| `:wq!` | Write and quit (force) |
| `:x` | Write if modified, then quit |
| `:x!` | Write and quit (force) |
| `:e filename` | Abandon current buffer and edit named file (fails if unsaved changes) |
| `:e! filename` | Abandon current buffer (discarding changes) and edit named file |
| `:r filename` | Read file and insert after current line |
| `:N` | Go to line number N (1-based) |
| `:$` | Go to last line (loads entire tail for large files) |

On quit (`ed.quit = 1`), the screen is **not** redrawn — the editor exits immediately after `term_restore()`.

## 11. Screen Rendering

### 11.1 Viewport
`top_pos` stores the buffer position of the first character visible on screen. It may point to the middle of a wide logical line (the start of a visual row resulting from line wrap). `scr_scroll_to_cursor()` adjusts `top_pos` when the cursor moves outside the visible area.

### 11.2 Long Line Wrapping
Lines wider than `scr_cols` wrap to additional screen rows. There is no horizontal scrolling. A visual row is one terminal line of content. The editor tracks visual rows using `next_vrow()` (advance one visual row) and `vrow_start_of()` (find the visual row containing a buffer position).

### 11.3 Status Bar
The bottom row (`scr_rows - 1`) shows either:
- A transient message stored in `ed.status` (search results, errors, mode indicators), displayed in reverse video; or
- The default status: `"filename" [+] L<current>/<total>` (filename in quotes, optional `[+]` if modified, current line number and total line count), also in reverse video. When the file has unloaded tail content (`ed.tail_offset > 0`), a `+` is appended to the total: `"filename" [+] L42/300+`.

Transient messages are cleared on the next keypress in normal mode, or replaced with `-- INSERT --` in insert mode.

### 11.4 Rendering Tiers (Performance)

All screen output is sized to the minimum needed for the operation. From cheapest to most expensive:

| Tier | Function | When used |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Cursor move only | `scr_update_cursor()` | `j`, `k`, `Enter`, `w`, `b`, `e`, `/`, `?`, `n`, `N`, `gg`, `nG` — viewport unchanged; terminal cursor repositioned (~10 bytes) |
| Cursor move only | `scr_show_status()` | `h`, `l`, `0`, `^`, `$`, `f`, `F`, `;`, `,` — text unchanged, cursor stays on-screen |
| Terminal scroll + 1 row | `scr_update_after_move(old_top)` | `j`, `k`, `Enter`, `w`, `b`, `e`, `/`, `?`, `n`, `N`, `gg`, `nG` — viewport shifts by exactly ±1 visual row (~53 bytes vs ~1200 for full refresh) |
| Current logical line [+ 1 extra] | `scr_redraw_cur_line()` | `r`, `x`, `X`, `D`, `~`, `s`, `S`, `C`, insert-mode Ctrl-U, Ctrl-W (within line) |
| Cursor row to bottom | `scr_redraw_from_cur()` | `J`, `o`, `O`, `p`, `P`, `u`, `dw`/`dd`/`cw`/etc., insert-mode Enter/BS-over-newline/Ctrl-W-across-newline, dot-repeat of insert/join — content above cursor unchanged |
| Full screen | `scr_refresh()` | `G`, Ctrl-F/B/D/U, `:` commands, large file tail load, viewport shift after any operation |

The `scr_redraw_from_cur()` tier (added in v1.1) is the key level: for any operation that modifies content at or below the cursor without moving `top_pos`, it skips all rows above the cursor. On a 24-row terminal with the cursor at the middle, this halves the terminal output compared to a full refresh.

`scr_update_after_move()` no longer updates the status bar for the no-scroll and ±1-scroll cases (it calls `scr_update_cursor()` instead). This eliminates ~58 bytes of status bar I/O per `j`/`k`/`Enter` keypress (~10 ms at 56K baud). The status bar refreshes on the next edit, search, full-screen command, or `Ctrl-L`.

**O(N) row rendering:** All multi-row drawing loops (`scr_refresh()`, `scr_redraw_from_cur()`, `scr_redraw_cur_line()`) use `draw_row_at(row, pos)`, a static helper that draws a row at a known buffer position. The calling loop advances `pos` with one `next_vrow()` call per row. The public `scr_redraw_line(row)` wrapper (used for single-row redraws) still scans from `top_pos`, but multi-row callers no longer pay the O(N²) rescan cost (previously, row N required N `next_vrow()` walks from `top_pos`, so a 23-row refresh cost 0+1+…+22 = 253 extra walks). The threaded approach reduces this to 23 walks total.

## 12. Terminal Interface (`term.c`)

All output uses `putchar()` to `stdout`. ANSI escape sequences used:

| Sequence | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `ESC[2J` | Clear screen |
| `ESC[K` | Clear to end of line |
| `ESC[r;cH` | Move cursor to row r, column c (1-based) |
| `ESC[1m` | Bold attribute |
| `ESC[7m` | Reverse video |
| `ESC[0m` | Reset attributes |
| `ESC[999;999H` + `ESC[6n` | Terminal size query (CPR) |
| `ESC[r;cR` | Terminal size response (parsed in `term_getsize`) |

Input uses `getch()` from the HI-TECH C runtime, which calls BIOS CONIN directly and returns immediately without echo. Terminal size reads use `bios(3,0,0)` (BIOS CONIN) to bypass BDOS buffering.

---

## 13. Operator-Motion Model (`emove.c`)

The `apply_op(op, from, to, linewise)` function applies an operator to a range:
- `'d'`: saves undo, saves to yank buffer, deletes range
- `'c'`: saves undo, saves to yank buffer, deletes range, calls `undo_save_insert`, enters insert mode
- `'y'`: saves to yank buffer only

`motion_endpoint(ch, count, &linewise)` computes the endpoint position for a given motion character and count. Supported motions: `h`, `l`, `w`, `b`, `e`, `$`, `0`, `^`, `j`, `k`, `G`.

---

## 14. Known Limitations

1. **Single-level undo.** Only the most recent change can be undone. `u` after `u` is a no-op.
2. **Edits restricted to loaded window.** For large files, only the in-memory portion is editable. The unloaded tail is preserved verbatim on save.
3. **Dot-repeat text truncated at 128 bytes.** Long insertions are truncated silently.
4. **Large-file backward paging reloads the full window.** `Ctrl-B` uses `gb_reload_from()` to reload from an earlier file offset, which clears all in-memory edits from the current window. Save before paging backward in large files to avoid data loss.
5. **No visual/block selection mode.**
6. **No macro recording or playback.**
7. **No window splitting.**
8. **No regex search** — plain substring match only.
9. **`~` (toggle case) is single-level undo per character.** With a count, only the last character's toggle is undoable.
10. **No `:s` (substitute) command.**
11. **Terminal size query may require Enter on some CP/M setups** if the BIOS CONIN is still line-buffered.
12. **Filenames limited to `PATH_MAX = 64` characters**, which exceeds CP/M's 8.3 limit but may be relevant on cross-platform use.

## 15. Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Single global `Editor` struct | Avoids pointer-passing overhead in K&R C; simplifies all function signatures |
| Gap buffer (not line array) | O(1) insert/delete at cursor; O(n) gap move is acceptable for typical edit patterns |
| Pre-allocated gap buffer (no resize) | CP/M has no virtual memory; `realloc` is unreliable; buffer is fixed at startup |
| Open file before `gb_init()` | Prevents heap exhaustion from leaving no room for `fopen()`'s I/O buffer |
| Single-level undo | Memory constraint: a full undo stack would require significant heap |
| Functions split for optimizer | HI-TECH C's optimizer has a per-function memory limit; large functions must be split |
| `erepeat.c` extracted from `edit.c` | HI-TECH C has a per-file total label limit; moving dot-repeat functions to a new file reduced `edit.c` below the limit |
| `long` variables at function top | Inner-block `long` declarations have been observed to cause optimizer failures |
| `gb_memmove()` in gap.c | HI-TECH C V3.09 does not include `memmove()` |
| BIOS CONIN for size query reads | BDOS console output between reads can consume buffered terminal response bytes |
| No `scr_refresh()` on quit | Avoids unnecessary terminal I/O when the user is about to see the shell prompt |
| `ZVITMP.TMP` for large-file saves | Prevents reading and writing the same file simultaneously when saving to the tail source |
| Dot-repeat captures text at ESC | At ESC time the inserted text is contiguous in the buffer at `undo.pos`; simple loop copies it |
| `scr_redraw_from_cur()` rendering tier | Skips rows above the cursor for operations that only change content at/below cursor; halves terminal output in the common case |
| `old_top` check before `scr_redraw_from_cur()` | Saved `top_pos` before `scr_scroll_to_cursor()` determines whether the viewport actually shifted; if not, the cheaper tier is used; if yes, full refresh |
| Search uses `scr_update_after_move()` | `/`, `?`, `n`, `N` move the cursor but don't change text; the terminal-scroll tier is sufficient for ±1-row jumps |
| `scr_update_after_move()` skips status bar for small moves | The `j`/`k`/`Enter` hot path calls `scr_update_cursor()` instead of `scr_show_status()` for no-scroll and ±1-scroll cases, saving ~58 bytes of terminal output (~10 ms at 56K baud) per keypress |
| `line_cnt_cached` avoids O(buffer) scan on every keypress | `scr_line_count()` scans the entire buffer to count newlines; caching the result and invalidating on `gb_insert()`/`gb_delete()` reduces this to O(1) on consecutive movement keystrokes |
| `draw_row_at(row, pos)` threads position through multi-row loops | Multi-row render loops (full refresh, cursor-to-bottom) previously re-walked from `top_pos` for each row — O(N²) total. Threading `pos` through reduces to O(N). Critical for page refresh responsiveness at 20 MHz Z80 |
| `nG` does not load the tail | With a count prefix, `G` jumps to a specific line number. Loading the full file tail (as bare `G` requires) is unnecessary; gating the tail-load loop by `!had_count` avoids the overhead and lets `scr_update_after_move()` use the cursor-only tier when the target line is already visible |
| Ctrl-F/B cursor in middle of new page | Standard vi places the cursor at the top of the new page; placing it in the middle gives a more balanced editing context and matches the feel of modern editors |
| Ctrl-F/B no-op at file boundaries | If already at the top (`top_pos == 0`) or the bottom (new top would not advance), no redraw is issued — avoids a visible flash/flicker for no-effect keypresses |
| `:e` resets gap buffer in-place | Rather than `gb_free()` + `gb_init()`, the buffer is emptied by resetting `gstart=0, gend=size`. This avoids `malloc`/`free` churn and the CP/M heap fragmentation risk |
| `ex_execute()` does not call `scr_refresh()` | All screen updates for ex commands are done by `cmdline_mode()` after `ex_execute()` returns, ensuring exactly one refresh per command regardless of which ex command ran |
| `mv_eol()` returns immediately on `\n` | When the cursor is already on a newline (empty line), `mv_eol()` previously walked forward past the `\n` onto the next line's content, causing `A` and `$` to land on the wrong line. An early return when `gb_char_at(cur_pos) == '\n'` corrects this |
| `G` uses `scr_refresh()` instead of `scr_update_after_move()` | After `gb_reload_from(0L)` resets `ed.top_pos` to 0, the saved `old_top` is also 0. `scr_update_after_move(0)` sees no viewport change and only calls `scr_update_cursor()`, leaving the screen blank. Using `scr_refresh()` unconditionally after `G` fixes this and is always correct since `G` is a large-distance jump |
| Static locals eliminate IX frames | HI-TECH C generates a 12–16 byte PUSH/POP IX stack frame for every function with at least one `auto` local. Declaring all locals `static` moves them to BSS and eliminates the frame. Safe because all ZVI functions are non-recursive and CP/M is single-threaded. See Section 7.3 |
| `gb_load_fp()` merged into `gb_load()` | Both functions were nearly identical. Adding a `FILE *fp` parameter to `gb_load()` (NULL = fopen internally) eliminates the entire `gb_load_fp()` function body and its IX frame |
| `scr_redraw_cur_vrow()` removed | Used only by `r` (replace). `scr_redraw_cur_line()` is a correct superset: it redraws the full logical line, which is identical for single-width lines and also handles wrapped lines. Removes ~60 bytes |
| `scr_line_end()` removed as dead code | Declared in `zvi.h`, defined in `screen.c`, but never called from anywhere in the codebase. Removing dead declarations and definitions reduces binary size without any functional change |
| Bitwise arithmetic for `TAB_STOP` | Tab-stop alignments historically use compiler-injected modulo/division code. We switched this block `((col / TAB_STOP + 1) * TAB_STOP)` to a hardware bitwise OR block `((col \| (TAB_STOP - 1)) + 1)` which compiles drastically smaller since `TAB_STOP` is 8 (a power of 2). |
| `begin_hmove`/`end_hmove` abstraction | Horizontal motion commands abstractly bracket updates to `ed.cur_pos`. The `end_hmove` block natively catches if a visual boundary crossing occurs on the physical screen (line wrap text) and correctly invalidates `ed.cur_vrow` to snap the UI rendering context back without redundant checks scattered. |
| Extract newline scans to `find_bol`/`find_eol` | 16+ inline while-loops repeating newline scanning logic across the code base were refactored into `gap.c` exports to cut binary block duplication via central CALL jumps. |
| Encapsulate `mv_find` inline command | The `f/F/;/;` character-find routines were moved from `edit.c` to `emove.c` (`mv_find()`) so they could operate under the secure caching brackets of `begin_hmove`, stopping UI freezing. We removed the "f_" status prompt to replicate pure vi mechanics. |
| Custom `ZIO` API over `stdio` | The heavy POSIX standard library I/O layer (`<stdio.h>`) was completely removed. Replaced by `zio.c` which directly maps to CP/M 128-byte block I/O (BDOS calls) using minimal `ZFILE` structs. |
| Custom `exit()` wrapper | Intercepts `exit()` with `bdos(0,0)` to prevent the Z88DK CRT from linking the massive `closeall()` auto-cleanup routine. |
| `CRT_ENABLE_COMMANDLINE=0` | The Z88DK command-line parser was bypassed in the `Makefile`. It implicitly pulled in `freopen` to handle `<` and `>` redirections, dragging the entire `stdio` layer with it. We parse CP/M DMA at `0x0080` directly instead. |
| `CLIB_OPEN_MAX=0` | Disables the pre-allocation of the 543-byte standard FCB pool in the BSS segment, freeing up more memory for the gap buffer. |
